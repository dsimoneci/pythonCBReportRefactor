# pythonCBReportRefactor

***Welcome!***

Thank you for taking the time to participate in this refactoring project.  This project is not meant to be THE go/no-go in our decision-making process.  Rather, itâ€™s meant as a tool for you to show your way of thinking and a little bit of showing off your Python skills.

Use the following instructions to complete the project.  

***Sample Code***

The Python script provided can be improved in a number of ways.  Also included is a sample output and sample dataset in SQLite.

***Requirements***

- Testing.  Indicate what changes you have tested and verified, and how you tested and verified them. You can include this through email or as comments in the script.
- Tools.  Feel free to use whatever IDE you like, whatever imports you fancy and basically whatever gets the job done.  Perhaps the only constraint is to use trusted sources for any libraries.
- Assume the sample Python script will grow in number of queries and reported metrics.  Extend or rework the script to support:
  - More reporting sections without hardcoding each reporting section.  The reporting sections should look the same as far as general layout, although the query and number of columns are unique to each section of output.
  - Configurable date ranges (you might have to adjust the SQL in sample), we might run the report weekly to see #s for the week, or we might change it up to run daily or even monthly.
- The script generates a text-only output file.  Revise to output a rich text format that supports images.
- This version of the script only creates an output file.  Add to the script to generate and send the output file via email to yourself.
- As long as we can get the gist of what you're trying to do, itâ€™s good.  This exercise is more about your process, approach and communicating back what you attempted, not Python and SQL syntax.
